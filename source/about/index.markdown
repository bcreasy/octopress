This site exists to serve as the central hub for my digital life.  A place on the internets, hosted and curated by me, that attempts to collect most of the things out there about me.  Here, you'll find web log posts I've written (and continue to write) over the years dating back to 2001, my professional resume, original media content, links to my various social networking/media sites, and much more. 

In May of 2013, I decided to put this site together.  Not including various social media sites, my public web presense sort of came to a halt in 2005 due to lack of interest in much other than work or World of Warcraft.  Since then, much has happened, yet not enough has been recorded.  That's where this site will hopefully do better.  I believe it's important to take ownership of everything I've written and created instead of relying on third party hosting services.  I've chosen [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) for the framework because it reminds me of a simpler time on the web when there were no database backends to deal with, when a web site was just a series of flat HTML pages.

##Who Are You?##

My name is Brian, but I will also answer to the names "genetik" and "Pipo".  I live in Austin, Texas, but I grew up and spent the first 30 years of my life in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  I live with a cat named Lina who is the smartest cat in the world.

Professionally, I am a Release Engineer currently working in the [retail point-of-sale](http://www.starmount.com/) industry.  I've previously worked in the [emergency response management](http://www.collaborativefusion.com/) industry doing web development in addition to release engineering.  My resume can be found <a href="{{ root_url }}/resume/" target="_blank">here</a>.

As with most people with an engineering mindset, I am interested in science-type things.  Biology, astronomy, and nutrition are the first to come to mind right now.  While most of my computers are Apple-made, I have a very strong background with \*nix platforms and prefer to interact with all computers through command line; FreeBSD and Debian Linux power my servers.

I am a cyclist.  Cycling plays a significant role in my life and health and is what takes up a majority of my spare time.  I track all of my ride data and post the logs to [Strava](http://www.strava.com).  You'll find a feed of my most recent rides on the side panel of this site.

When I'm not working or riding my bike, I like to watch films and television shows, listen to podcasts, and read books.
