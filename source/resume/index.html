			<h2>A Geek, Both In and Outside of Work</h2>
			<div class="general">
				<p>While not at work, I enjoy riding my bicycle for fun and training with competitive racing as a goal. I also enjoy playing video games. I'm am retired from World of Warcraft where, for almost 6 years, much of my spare time was devoted to managing a raiding guild and leading a tactical team of 25-30 other people. While this may have taken place in the realm of an online video game, the people were real and the managerial skills I gained from it over the years have shown real life professional benefits.</p>
				<p>I am a grammar nerd for all languages, programming and natural. I strive to remove ambiguity in everything I do and following semantical and structural standards is usually a good means to that end. Less ambiguity means less confusion and better communication for all.</p>
