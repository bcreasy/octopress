			<h2>A Geek, Both In and Outside of Work</h2>
			<div class="general">
				<p>While not at work, I enjoy riding my bicycle for fun, training, and competitive racing. I love recording data from each ride and then studying the metrics to identify areas of improvement. Historical data is key for identifying if improvement has occurred over time.</p>
				<p>From 2005 to 2011, much of my spare time was devoted to creating and managing a World of Warcraft raiding guild, leading a tactical team of 25-30 other people. While this may have taken place in the realm of an online video game, the people were real and the management skills I gained from it over the years have shown real life professional benefits.</p>
				<p>I am a grammar nerd for all languages, programming and natural. I strive to remove ambiguity in everything I do -- following semantical and structural standards is usually a good means to that end. Less ambiguity with consistent language means less confusion and better communication for all.</p>
