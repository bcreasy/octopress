the media coverage summed up in one quote:

> "Now, for you people who are saying, 'Well, stop pointing fingers at the president...left-wing...the media's being too hard':
> 
> No.  SHUT...UP!  No!  This is inarguably---inarguably---a failure of leadership from the top of the federal government.  Remember when Bill Clinton went out with Monica Lewinsky? That was inarguably a failure of judgment at the top. Democrats had to come out and risk losing credibility if they did not condemn Bill Clinton for his behavior.
> 
> I believe Republicans are in the same position right now. And I will say this: Hurricane Katrina is George Bush's Monica Lewinsky. The only difference is that tens of thousands of people weren't stranded in Monica Lewinsky's vagina."
