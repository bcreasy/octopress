Greetings visitors.  As you might notice, I haven't updated this site in quite some time.  There are a few reasons for that.  One is that I got a full-time job with the IT department of a school district.  Another is that I've been working on other projects of my own.  Any little updates I've made since the last update on here have been made on my <a href="http://www.lebwog.com/genetik/" title="genetik's log">web log</a>.  I don't plan on updating stuff on here any time in the forseeable future, so check out the web log.

You can still, however, still use this site as a guide to what music I'm currently listening to as that is not on my web log site. (I should add that...)
