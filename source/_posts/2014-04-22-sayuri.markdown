### Hard Drive Death

Unfortunately, shortly after she was racked, Sayuri began to show signs of drive degradation with slow write speeds.  There were no kernel messages at first, but after a while, they started flying in.  The second drive must have got damaged during shipment.

"Ugh.  I don't want to have to deal with this," I thought, as my stomach sank a little bit.  I'd have to have the drive shipped back to me, then buy a new hard drive, then watch 20 youtube videos on how to take apart a Mac Mini to replace the drive.  Then I'd have to ship it back to the colo, hoping that it didn't suffer the same fate.

But I didn't have to do any of that!  I opened a ticket with MacStadium and asked them how they usually handle this, as I'm sure it happens frequently for them.  They replied back within a half hour saying "We can replace it no problem with Genuine Apple parts.  Which drive model is it? 1TB 5400 RPM? 500GB 5400 RPM? 500GB 7200 RPM? Other?"

Holy crap!  They'll swap out the drive for me?!  I totally wasn't expecting that level of service.  Hardware maintenance was always something I had to do on my own with Nayuki and Shiori and after moving away from Pittsburgh, I had to have friends/family do maintenance for me.
