&gt; Greetings Professor Falken.

It's been a while since I've had any sort of public web log content online.  Hell, it's been a while since I've had any sort of public web presence at all (not including <a href="http://twitter.com/genetik">various</a> <a href="http://profiles.google.com/genetik">social</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/genetik123">media</a> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/genetik">sites</a>).  I feel the bug to put myself out there again.

To bring myself up to that point, I felt it important to include all of the posts I had on my previous web log sites.  Yes, this means bringing back to life slightly embarrassing posts from my early 20s.  If someone really wanted to, they could easily <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041206112155/http://caffeine.nu/index.php?all=1">find this stuff on their own</a>, so I figure why not just own it.  Nothing on the internet is ever deleted, after all.  Only two sources of posts have been imported so far: my old caffeine.nu homebrew site and my old "lebwog" wordpress site.  I may end up importing more historical content from places like geocities, myspace and orkut, but not yet.

The purpose of this site is to be the central hub for my digital life, hosted and curated by me.  Here, anyone can easily find my accounts on various services as well as read random thoughts and original content I felt were necessary to share with the universe.
