&gt; Greetings Professor Falken.

It's been a while since I've had any sort of public web log content online.  Hell, it's been a while since I've had any sort of public web presence at all (not including [various](http://twitter.com/genetik) [social](http://profiles.google.com/genetik) [media](http://www.youtube.com/genetik123) [sites](http://www.linkedin.com/in/genetik)).  I feel the bug to put myself out there again.

To bring myself up to that point, I felt it important to include all of the posts I had on my previous web log sites.  Yes, this means bringing back to life slightly embarrassing posts from the early 2000s when I was in my early 20s .  If someone really wanted to, they could easily [find this stuff on their own](http://web.archive.org/web/20041206112155/http://caffeine.nu/index.php?all=1), so I figure why not just own it.  Nothing on the internet is ever deleted, after all.  Only three sources of posts have been imported so far: my old caffeine.nu homebrew site, my old "lebwog" wordpress site, and select tumblr posts.  I may end up importing more historical content from places like geocities, myspace and orkut, but not yet.

The purpose of this site is to be the central hub for my digital life, hosted and curated by me.  Here, anyone can easily find my accounts on various services as well as read random thoughts and original content I felt were necessary to share with the universe.

So scroll back and enjoy the old content.  Stick around and enjoy the future content!
