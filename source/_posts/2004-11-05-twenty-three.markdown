happy birthday to me.  i turned 23 years old yesterday (04nov).  in the past, i'd always go around telling people it was my birthday.  this year, i kept to myself about it to see if anyone actually remembered on their own.  turns out no one aside from mom and dad did.  oh well.  i didn't really expect anyone to remember, so don't feel bad if you didn't.
