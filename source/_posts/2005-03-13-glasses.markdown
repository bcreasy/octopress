I've had glasses since sometime between 11th and 12th grade in high school.  Since then, which is about six or seven years ago, I've worn them probably less than 50 times.  Even though my girlfriend at the time when I first got them said that I looked really good with them on, I just didn't see myself as wearing glasses and I thought that they didn't help with looks at all.

Suffice to say, the residual image that I keep of myself seems to have changed.  A few weekends ago, I went down to Washington, D.C. to visit some friends.  While I was down there, I wore my glasses pretty much the whole time.  When I would wear my glasses in the past, I always enjoyed the experience.  I enjoyed being able to see individual blades of grass instead of just patches of slightly detailed green.  I enjoyed being able to recognize the little shimmering effect that moving water gives out.  For some reason, I still refused to wear them in the past.

No more.

While I said that my residual image has changed, the more I think about it, I realize that it hasn't changed but has always included glasses (along with not weighing as much).  I only came to realize this after seeing a [picture](http://gallery.lebwog.com/seele/DC_feb_05/Party022_small) that [Celeste](http://weblog.obso1337.org) had taken of me while I was down in D.C...  I liked how I looked.

Another nice thing about wearing glasses is that I can read for a longer period of time without getting tired.  I like that.

I like how I look with glasses on and I plan on wearing my glasses for a long time to come...
