this past friday, while everyone else was shopping, i was at wildwood highlands participating in their second ddr tournament.  what a fun time that was.  got to see a couple of the really good players show off their stuff.  and i even placed second in the maniac division.  sean took videos of our stuff and some of the impressive others'.  he's going to capture those when he gets back up to school and then i'll post them somewhere for you all to grab.
