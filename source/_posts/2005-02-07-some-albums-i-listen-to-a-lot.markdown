When I listen to music that I like, I tend to listen to the same album or series of albums for at least a day straight and usually longer.  There are a good handful of albums that, no matter how many times I listen to them, don't get old or overplayed: (in no special order)

* Mae - Destination: Beautiful
* DJ Tiesto - In Search of Sunrise: 3
* BT - Emotional Technology
* Punchline - Rewind EP
* Thrice - The Illusion of Safety
* The Fully Down - No Fate... But What We Make For Ourselves
* Lagwagon - Let's Talk About Friends
* Something Corporate - Leaving Through The Window
* Yellowcard - Ocean Avenue
* Madonna - Ray of Light
* Estradasphere - Its Understood
* The Postal Service - Give Up
* Radiohead - OK Computer, Radiohead - The Bends (back to back)
* All four Faith No More albums in series

That's just a small list of some of the albums I can throw on and listen to for a few days without thinking anything of it (and I have).  More than likely, one of the albums on that list is in my car CD player right now.
