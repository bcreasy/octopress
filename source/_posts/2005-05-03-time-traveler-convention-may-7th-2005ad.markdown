###What is it?###

[Technically, you would only need one time traveler convention.](http://catandgirl.com/view.php?loc=131) Time travelers from all eras could meet at a specific place at a specific time, and they could make as many repeat visits as they wanted. We are hosting the first and only Time Traveler Convention at MIT in one week, and WE NEED YOUR HELP!

###Why do you need my help?###

We need you to help PUBLICIZE the event so that future time travelers will know about the convention and attend.  This web page is insufficient; in less than a year it will be taken down when I graduate, and futhermore, the World Wide Web is unlikely to remain in its present form permanently. We need volunteers to publish the details of the convention in enduring forms, so that the time travelers of future millennia will be aware of the convention. This convention can never be forgotten! We need publicity in MAJOR outlets, not just Internet news. Think New York Times, Washington Post, books, that sort of thing. If you have any strings, please pull them.

###Great idea, I'd love to help! What should I do?###

Write the details down on a piece of acid-free paper, and slip them into obscure books in academic libraries! carve them into a clay tablet! If you write for a newspaper, insert a few details about the convention! Tell your friends, so that word of the convention will be preserved in our oral history! A note: Time travel is a hard problem, and it may not be invented until long after MIT has faded into oblivion. Thus, we ask that you include the latitude/longitude information when you publicize the convention.

You can also make an absolute commitment to publicize the convention afterwards. In that case, bring a time capsule or whatever it may be to the party, and then bury it afterwards.

###Can't the time travelers just hear about it from the attendees, and travel back in time to attend?###

Yes, they can! In fact, we think this will happen, and the small number of adventurous time travelers who do attend will go back to their "home times" and tell all their friends to come, causing the convention to become a Woodstock-like event that defines humanity forever.

Unfortunately, we of the present (2005) don't have time travel, and so we only have one chance at observing the convention. If the time travelers don't leave us their secrets, we won't be able to go back in time and see our convention in all its glory unless it is publicized *in advance*.

###Isn't time travel impossible?###

We can't know for certain. The ancient Greeks would have thought computers were impossible, and the Phoenicians certainly wouldn't have believed that humans would one day send a spacecraft to the moon and back. We cannot predict the future of science or technology, so we can only make an effort and see if any time travelers come to our convention. If you would like to read more about time travel, check out our [reading list](http://web.mit.edu/adorai/timetraveler/readinglist.html).

###I'm from the future, and I'd like to attend!###

We're not sure how you're emailing us from the future, but we'd love to have you! Come as you are! No dress code whatsoever. We do request that you bring some sort of proof that you do indeed come from the future, and haven't just dressed like you do. We welcome any sort of proof, but things like a cure for AIDS or cancer, a solution for global poverty, or a cold fusion reactor would be particularly convincing as well as greatly appreciated.

###I'm from the present, and I'd like to attend!###

Great! We would also love to have you, especially if you have helped publicize. We request that you bring refreshments if possible, as we need to make this a great party for you and for the time travelers. [RSVP](mailto:timetravelerconvention@gmail.com) at timetravelerconvention@gmail.com, and then show up at the designated place at the designated time! The [East Campus](http://web.mit.edu/adorai/timetraveler/ec.html) Courtyard is in between the two red rectangles on [this map](http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?mapterms=east+campus). If you plan on attending, **PLEASE** check this page frequently for updates. **UPDATE 5/2**: Convention events start at 8pm now. Feel free to come at either 8pm, 10pm, or anytime in between. We'd recommend coming early as we hope to get some very interesting speakers and musicians for this time.

###I'm from the present, and I'd like to attend, but I can't!###

No worries! If time travel is invented in your lifetime, you can always come later. Even if it isn't, we'll have pictures and video up at this site within a week after the Convention.

###I've volunteered and helped publicize!###

Thanks! If you'd like to be included in the [gallery](http://web.mit.edu/adorai/timetraveler/gallery/), please send us a picture of your publicity effort by [email](mailto:timetravelerconvention@gmail.com) at timetravelerconvention@gmail.com. You can also email us with any other questions you might have.
