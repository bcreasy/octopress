A few weeks ago, I bought a new phone: a Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini.  I'm excited about this change.

I'd been using an iPhone since January 2009 when I got an iPhone 3G.  From there, I got an iPhone 4 in January 2011 and then an iPhone 5 in November 2012.  I've been generally happy with the Apple ecosystem.  I use iTunes to manage my master music archive at home and I love it.  However, other than that, I don't take advantage of many Apple ecosystem services.  The majority of online services I use are through Google.  Most Google services work pretty seamlessly with iOS, however, so I never really complained.

One simple comment a friend of mine made has stuck in my head, though.  A year or so ago, a friend of mine was in town for a conference and we met up for dinner.  I hadn't seen her in a few years and it was cool to hang out again.  But when I took out my phone (an iPhone 4 at the time), she said, "huh.. you have an iPhone... I would have expected you to have an Android phone with all sorts of custom mods."  This kept resonating in my head because she was right to be surprised.  Now, I know that the things you own don't define you, but they can definitely hint at your personality, beliefs, and lifestyle.  Plainly put, an iPhone doesn't fit with 

A modern cell phone, to me, is four things:
1. A communication device (voice, sms, email, chat)
2. A personal organizer (calendar, reminders, notepad)
3. An information retrieval device (internet access)
4. Photo and video camera

Some will argue for having phones be able to play movies, videos, music and games.  These functions encourage distracting yourself from your environment, which I have no interest in doing.
