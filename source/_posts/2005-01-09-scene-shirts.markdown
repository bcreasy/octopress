I was passed along a link this evening to a <strike>[rather cool CafePress store](http://www.cafepress.com/spreadscene "Spread The Scene Store")</strike>.  Someone created a store that sells t-shirts with Scene group ANSI art logos on the fronts of them.  However, as much as I'd like to have one of them (especially a Fairlight or VideoCD one), I won't be buying one.  The reason is simple: I don't like white t-shirts.  I've always disliked CafePress for not selling black t-shirts.  If they were black, I would probably have already bought one of each.

I also wouldn't mind a razor1911 shirt.  It would also be cool to see this same thing done but with mp3 groups.

*Edit:*

Well, that sucks.  I guess they took the store down.  Too bad.  So sad.
