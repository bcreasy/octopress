a stupid little quiz that a few of my friends had taken.  pretty much accurate, i'd say:

> Your soul is STEADFAST. You are a fiercely loyal person who would never cross a loved one.
> 
> People always know they can rely on you and your dependability is well-known. You're probably a little on the quiet side, but your faithfulness is never doubted, and you always back up your kith and kin whether they want or need it or not. You are a dependable and trusted soul.
