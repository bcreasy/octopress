On April 18th and 19th of 2015, I'll be taking part in the BP MS 150 fundraising bicycle ride and I'd like you to help me donate.

## What is the MS 150? ##

The MS 150 is a yearly regional bicycle charity ride that takes place over two days and covers a distance of about 150 miles.  The people who take part in the ride pay a registration fee of $100 and are required to fund raise an additional minimum of $400.  All of the fund raising money goes toward the [National Multiple Sclerosis Society](http://www.nationalmssociety.org/), a non-profit organization which helps people affected by a disease called *Multiple Sclerosis*.

## Why should you donate? ##

First, you should know what Multiple Sclerosis is:

Multiple sclerosis is a totally messed up and crazy neurological autoimmune disease whose cause is unknown where the insulation of a person's nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are attacked by their body's own immune system.  When the damage to this insulation is severe enough, it *will* cause pretty much any kind of neuromuscular or cognitive dysfunction or disability, depending on the location of the damage.  Leg muscles, eyes, speech, and cognition are usually most affected.  Sclerae roughly means "scar" or "lesion", in this case of white matter in the brain and spinal cord.  When the damage done to nerve cells causes more than one of these lesions over time, you usually get the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

Those afflicted by MS are typically first diagnosed in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, though it can occur to people of any age.  There are different types of MS, based on the frequency and intensity of the autoimmune attack.  The most common type is RRMS, or Relapsing-Remitting MS.  This type is identified by an attack with symptoms, followed by a period of remission with less noticeable symptoms or none at all.  This period of remission can last anywhere from months to years with no symptoms before the next attack.

**People with RRMS may not even present with any obvious symptoms at all after their attacks subside.  Hell, you could know someone with it and not have any idea.**

Nevertheless, people with MS are taking medication daily or weekly to try to keep the attacks away while otherwise living normal lives.  These are the lucky ones.  Eventually, over time, until the human race figures out how to reverse the damage to the nerve cells, they'll likely end up presenting with more obvious symptoms most of the time.  Those with other, more aggressive forms of MS are often unable to walk, talk, see, or think properly.  On top of that, life expectancy of those with MS is typically 5-10 years lower than unaffected people.  There are currently over 2 million people with this disease.

That is why you should donate.

Because of how this disease can randomly completely screw with the lives otherwise healthy people and those around them, I'd like you to join me in donating to the National MS Society so we can help fund research toward more effective treatment and eventually a cure.

## How to donate ##

I'd prefer you to contribute directly through me, as it will lessen my financial burden.  I'm contractually obligated to hand over $400 no matter what before I can ride in the event.  Your donation through my fundraising page will still go straight to the National MS Society and it's tax deductible via 501&#40;c)(3) if you're into that.  I urge you to donate anything you can, regardless of my fundraising goal.

## How to learn more about MS ##
Obviously, the [National Multiple Sclerosis Society](http://www.nationalmssociety.org/) is a good place to start.

Wikipedia has a great article about [Multiple Sclerosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis).

If you want something a little less technical, [Simple Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis) has a broad overview.
